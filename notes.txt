Problem - We need to start prepping for launch. I am afraid we've moved so fast without testing things.


Thoughts - The next step should be to get confidence in the FUNCTIONALITY of the app. If this MVP does not work
then the rest is History. We should stop pouring features on this and make sure things work. In addition to that,
we should make sure things look professional. So there will be functionality fixes AND UI polish happening.


Thoughts - To the above, let's test both sides of the experience.


User Types:

- Nurse
- Patients


Nurse - Use Cases - Signup

- Initial login/signup [x]
- Subsequent signup/login [x]


Nurse - Use Cases - Views (exclude signup)

- Home
- Bookings
- Settings

Nurse - Use Cases - Settings

- None setup
- Availability setup
- Both availability and services setup


Nurse Use Cases - Bookings

- No appointments
- Appointments


Patient - Use Cases - Booking for the first time

- First patient to book
- Not the first patient to book, but for the first time
- Not the first patient to book, but for a follow-up time


Outstanding

- Get the texting side ready to go


Onboarding Plan (being updated as I test)

- Create account via login page (magic link)
- Go to email and open up magic link
- Finish setup (first, last name and org)
- Settings (for me internally, really)
    - Collect the following from nurses
        - Availability
        - Services
    - Update the data via mutations
        - Availability - configureAvailability
        - Services - configureNurseServices
- Set the top services
    - Collect the following from nurses:
        - Top services -- 2 - 
    - Update the data via mutations
        - This is done with the first mutation actually; otherwise db write
