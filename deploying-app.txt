Deploying the App

We use different systems for this:

- Supabase - Edge functions and storage for user data
- Neon - DB for the NestJS app
- Render - The NestJS app
- Vercel - The FE app


Supabase - High Level Overview
- As mentioned above, we host edge functions, authentication and
  storage for this.
- There are two "projects"/environments for this -- dev and prod
  - dev is used for local development

Supabase - Deploying
- When deploying, we need to make sure:
  - The edge functions are deployed on prod (ensure callable)
  - The DB is migrated
    - dev - supabase db pull
    - prod - supabase db push
    - notes - ensure you link before each command
  - Environment variables (Ensure they mirror dev)


Neon - High Level Overview
- We use this as the app db for production

Neon - Deploying
- Locally, we generate the migration; commit
- Locally, we run the migration (MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT HAVE THE DEV SERVER ON)
  - For env vars - look it up on neon


Render - High Level
- Used for deploying the web service -- NestJS

Render - Deploying
- Just push -- just know, as of this writing, we use the free tier (dynos sleep and migration are manual)


Vercel - High Level
- Used for the react app

Vercel - Deploying
- Just push

Getting env vars for prod

- Twilio
  - Account SID
  - API key
  - From number
- Supabase
    - The public key -- get it from settings -> api keys
    - The anon -- same as above
